= <RFC title>

== Summary

> One paragraph explanation of the feature.

== Motivation

> Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
> outcome?

== Detailed design

> This is the bulk of the RFC.

> Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
> familiar with the framework to understand, and for somebody familiar with the
> implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases,
> and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be
> defined here.
